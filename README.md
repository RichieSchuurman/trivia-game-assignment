# Trivia Assigment

## About the assignment
For this assignment we build a trivia game with Vue and Vite. Questions are provided by the open source API from Open Trivia DB and userData(id, username, highscore) is saved in the noroff-assignment-api
With this trivia game you're able to:
- Store your username and highscore.
- Select your own questions by giving the amount, difficulty, type, and category.
- Check your score and match your answers in the provided table


## How to use
This application is deployed with Heroku so you're able to directly access it with following link [Trivia Game]() or click on the heroku badge above.

If you want to run the application on your local machine, clone the repo as normal and follow bellow steps.

## Future work
- Add responsive design for mobile

## Additional Notes 
Some API calls from the Open Trivia DB will give back empty responses or cause the questions and answers being mixed up in the results table
You can find the wireframes and component tree on my Figma community page. However the component tree is included with this project.
